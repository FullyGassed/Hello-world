Left 4 Dead 2 Level Creation Project
====================================
Hello world! This readme is both a breif out-line of my aims, but also a self-assesment and record of the things I have currently learnt and plan to lern over the course of this project. I'm learning about game development in my free time, with a goal to make a to scale map of sections of my home town to feature in the video game "Left 4 Dead 2". My aim is to re-create and adjust the current real-world town using "Hammer", a piece of software that makes up the "Left 4 Dead 2 Authoring tool.". To do this I must learn coding skills and increase my familiarity with the software. I am currently using Valve's own guide for the software, which I find to be detailed and helpful.
====================================
I have recently learnt how to use brushes to create 3D shapes. copy and texture 3D shapes, place props and entities into an enviroment, manipulation of 3D shapes to create natural looking enviromants and most recently I have looked into creating Map Navs for AI to follow, but i am yet to implement this into a compiled map.
====================================
Current objectives: -become familiar with the Map Navigation system and use it in conjunction with the "Director". The Director is the games AI which reads charcater placement, cureent health, inventory and other factors to decide which enemies spawn, the frquency and how many. frequency is often bases partly on a timing system, this help to keep the game "flowing" and helps to make travelling less monotonous by giving a contextual level of difficulty. An example of this may be a particular spawn reffered to in-game as a jockey. These enemmies can mount the player, disable the use of weapons, slightly alter the veiwing by changing the camera tint to a green and black overlay. This is both to restrict veiw and to reference to the ifection that the enemies are infected with. The reason for referencing this particular enemie is because it tends to spawn when a player character is seperated from the group, this makes the enemy more affecting as it can damage the player without iteruption from other player characters or NPCs. 

Future objectives: - Create and link multiple environments to make a linear campaign using Map Nav to assign start and end points of each individual enviroment whic in the end create a completed linear map.
