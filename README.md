Left 4 Dead 2 Level Creation Project

Hello world! I'm currently learning about game development in my free time, with a goal to make a to scale map of sections of my home town to feature in the video game "Left 4 Dead 2". My aim is to re-create and adjust the current real-world town using "Hammer", a piece of software that makes up the "Left 4 Dead 2 Authoring tool.". To do this I must learn coding skills and increase my familiarity with the software. I am currently using Valve's own guide for the software, which I find to be detailed and helpful.
